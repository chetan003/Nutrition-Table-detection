# Nutrition-Table-detection

Understanding how to read the nutrition facts on food labels might help one make
better decisions in life. Nutrition labels give information on the nutritional content of
pre-packaged goods at the moment of sale. Labeling information is usually included
on the back of food packaging (for example, nutritional lists), although it can also be
found on the front (e.g. symbols). Nutrition labels can be interpretive, in the sense
that colors or symbols are used to help consumers comprehend the information on
the label, or non-interpretive, in the sense that quantitative nutrient data is provided
without any interpretation. The nutrition label lists the calories, carbohydrates, fat,
fiber, protein, and vitamins in each serving of the item, making it easy to compare
the nutrition of similar goods. Itâ€™s important to compare different brands of the same
meal since nutrition information can vary greatly.
